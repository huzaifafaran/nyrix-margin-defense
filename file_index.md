Group Governance Framework
The Group Governance Framework serves as a comprehensive and strategic mechanism designed to meticulously oversee the expansive operations of YBH as a conglomerate, encompassing a varied array of subsidiaries and business units. The primary aim of this framework is to secure effective oversight, foster accountability, promote ethical behavior, and pave the way for the enduring success of the organization's diverse portfolio. This intricate governance structure is intricately woven with the principles outlined in the Family Constitution, delineating the meticulous process through which family shareholders delegate their powers to the respective Boards.

In addition to its overarching responsibilities, the YBH Board takes a proactive role in establishing and disseminating policy guidelines that govern the subsidiaries. A crucial aspect of this governance cascade is the requirement for each subsidiary's management to report to their respective boards. Subsequently, following thorough scrutiny and approval at the individual board levels, this information is consolidated and presented to the YBH Board for final endorsement. Despite the collective legal ownership of YBH by family shareholders, the delegation of authority to the YBH Board is a strategic move to ensure the seamless and efficient operational functioning of the conglomerate.

The Company's Board of Directors, a collective of highly qualified individuals boasting diverse expertise, stands as a cornerstone in this governance framework. Notably, this composition includes both independent and non-independent directors, a deliberate measure aimed at fostering a balanced and objective decision-making process within the company.

Following initiatives are undertaken by each entity to adhere to best practices:

Appointment of Independent Directors
Establishment of Board Audit Committee
Establishment of Human Resource Committee
Institutionalization of Internal Controls and formation of Internal Audit Department
Implementation of Risk Management Framework and Policies
Appointment of External Auditors

Performance and profitability:
The Net revenue has witnessed a notable 19% upswing, rising from PKR 84 billion to PKR 100  billion in December 2023. It is crucial to highlight that there has been an average devaluation of PKR by approximately 29% compared to the same period last year, additionally our export sales in USD terms have also declined by 10%. Furthermore, the gross margin percentage to sales has experienced a slight decrease, dropping from 24.87% to 23.20%. This decline can be attributed to a substantial spike in the prices of the raw materials consumed, power and electricity and increase in minimum wage of labors (PKR 25,000 to PKR 32,000). 

Operating expenses have increased by PKR 1.2 billion. Notably, this rise is primarily attributed to salaries and benefits by PKR 899 million, promotion and exhibition by PKR 148 million, depreciation and amortization by PKR 112 million netted off by drop in transportation and freight expenses by PKR 169 million. Company wise details are presented in a separate slide.
  
Other operating expenses have increased by PKR 194 million mainly due to increase in WPPF by PKR 59 million WWF by PKR 73 million, donations by PKR 28 million and  loss of biological assets by PKR 39 million. Moreover, Other income has surged by PKR 1.39 billion, mainly driven by increased dividend income, profits from bank and gain on disposal of associate (NRL), which rose by PKR 855 million, PKR 163 million and PKR 251 million respectively. 
There has been an increase of PKR 444 million in the share of profit from associate mainly due to LCI (increase of PKR 485 million).
 
Unrealized Gain/Loss on Investment held on fair value - OCI:
For the current period, we have recorded an unrealized gain of PKR 11.3 billion, in contrast to a loss of PKR 525 million in the same period last year. This favorable shift is primarily attributed to the significant improvement in the performance of Lucky Cement (rise by PKR 11.6 billion) as share prices per share has increased from PKR 522 to PKR 787 during the period.

However, upon adjusting for the devaluation of PKR by 29% , the export revenue has declined in USD term by 11%. Overall Gross profit margin % has slightly increased to 30% (compared to 28% in December 2022), leading to a rise in operating profit by PKR 1.5 billion. Further, the finance costs have exhibited a significant decline by 24% which can be attributed to repayment of financing facilities. Share of Profit has increased by PKR 2.14 billion as compared to SPLY primarily due to share of profit from Lucky Cement by PKR 1.7 billion.
2.LTML sales in PKR have increased by 10% as compared to SPLY. Exports in USD value has declined by 9% approx. but due to the devaluation of PKR overall exports in PKR have increased by PKR 2.1 billion. Rise in current year revenue also includes exchange gain amounting to PKR 295 million. There is a decrease in Gross margin from 27% to 23% due to devaluation of PKR netted of with increase in production cost. Other income on the contrary has increased by PKR 370 million which is mainly due to mutual funds dividend and interest income.

3.GTML sales has demonstrated a notable 26% increase when compared to the similar period last year (SPLY), rising from PKR 29.9 billion to PKR 37.7 billion. Export revenue has shown an increase of PKR 881 million, representing a 19% growth when compared to the last period. Overall Gross profit margin has decreased to 7% (compared to 11% in December 2022), leading to a net loss before factoring in the share of profit from associates. However, the share of profit from associates amounts to PKR 790 million, resulting in a net profit of PKR 256 million. The spinning division which constitutes approx. 89% to the total revenue, upon segmenting the company's P&L statement, suffers a loss of PKR 5.7 million. The significant upsurge in finance costs is primarily attributed to higher markup rate and a substantial increase in banking debt as of December 2023 compared to December 2022.

4.Yunus Energy revenue has increased by PKR 1.76 billion due to better wind conditions resulting in PKR 1.38 billion (i.e 146%) increase in profits as compared to SPLY.

Other income has a fall of 44% as compared to SPLY due to no exchange gain during the period (SPLY: Rs. 117 million) and decline in interest income by Rs. 28 million netted off by an increase in dividend income by Rs. 68 million.

Super Tax –  Commencing June 30, 2022, and continuing thereafter, a super tax is imposed on individuals with high earnings exceeding PKR 150 million. The super tax is levied at rates ranging from 1% to 4%, depending on income slabs. Moreover, certain industries such as Automobiles, Cement, Chemicals, Textile, etc., witnessing incomes surpassing PKR 300 million, are subject to an elevated super tax rate of 10% (instead of 4%).In Tax Year 2022, a 4% Super Tax was remitted as directed by the High Court of Sindh, with an additional 6% security cheque held in the court's custody.In Tax Year 2023, the Company contested the validity of the amendment pertaining to the imposition of 'Super Tax on high earning individuals' under section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, through legal channels. A Writ Petition no. 3966/2023 was filed before the Honorable Islamabad High Court (IHC) by the Company's legal advisors. The IHC, via its interim order dated December 8, 2023, ruled that any Super Tax exceeding the prescribed rate before the challenged amendment would not be collected. Additionally, the Final tax regime was excluded from the Super Tax scope in accordance with the Interim order issued by the Islamabad High Court.Subsequently, the Department initiated an appeal in the Supreme Court of Pakistan contesting the Territorial Jurisdiction of the Islamabad High Court in Super Tax cases. The matter concerning Super Tax in the Supreme Court has been remanded back to the Islamabad High Court. The IHC is directed to decide on the point of territorial jurisdiction within 30 days, following which our stay application will be reconsidered, effectively rendering it pending.

Performance and profitability:
The Net revenue has witnessed a notable 19% upswing, rising from PKR 84 billion to PKR 100  billion in December 2023. It is crucial to highlight that there has been an average devaluation of PKR by approximately 29% compared to the same period last year, additionally our export sales in USD terms have also declined, however, local sales have seen a rise by PKR 9.1 billion. Furthermore, the gross margin percentage to sales has experienced a slight decrease, dropping from 24.87% to 23.20%. This decline can be attributed to a substantial spike in the prices of the raw materials consumed, power and electricity and increase in minimum wage of labors (PKR 25,000 to PKR 32,000). 

Operating expenses have increased by PKR 1.2 billion. Notably, this rise is primarily attributed to salaries and benefits by PKR 899 million, promotion and exhibition by PKR 148 million, depreciation and amortization by PKR 112 million netted off by drop in transportation and freight expenses by PKR 169 million. Company wise details are presented in a separate slide.
  
Other operating expenses have increased by PKR 194 million mainly due to increase in WPPF by PKR 59 million WWF by PKR 73 million, donations by PKR 28 million and  loss of biological assets by PKR 39 million. Moreover, Other income has surged by PKR 1.39 billion, mainly driven by increased dividend income, profits from bank and gain on disposal of associate (NRL), which rose by PKR 855 million, PKR 163 million and PKR 251 million respectively. 
There has been an increase of PKR 444 million in the share of profit from associate mainly due to LCI (increase of PKR 485 million).
 
Unrealized Gain/Loss on Investment held on fair value - OCI:
For the current period, we have recorded an unrealized gain of PKR 11.3 billion, in contrast to a loss of PKR 525 million in the same period last year. This favorable shift is primarily attributed to the significant improvement in the performance of Lucky Cement (rise by PKR 11.6 billion) as share prices per share has increased from PKR 522 to PKR 787 during the period.

IMPLICATION OF SUPER TAX & ITS WAY FORWARD 
KEY UPDATES

INTER CORPORATE DIVIDEND - Tax Matters
BRIEF SUMMARY OF INTER CORPORATE DIVIDEND W.R.T Y.B. HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LIMITED

 In 2013, the group of YB Holdings was formed, and all the Directors transferred their shares of all the subsidiaries through a transfer agreement to YB Holdings for the group's formation.
 
Before March 2021, inter corporate dividends were exempt from tax under the following group structure:
 
(i) Holding company and 100% owned subsidiaries entitled to group taxation and filing group return (59AA); and
(ii) Holding company and subsidiary companies eligible for group relief (59B).
 
Through the Amendment Ordinance 2021, the exemption for inter corporate dividend stated in (ii) (highlighted above) has been withdrawn.
 
From 2008 till 2016, there was no change made in the framework. In 2016, the law was changed when exemption for inter corporate dividend was withdrawn. However, the Government realized the mistake and made appropriate corrections in 2019 and 2020 to restore the framework in its original position to a significant extent.
 
Again in 2021, exemption for inter corporate dividend has been withdrawn and no consideration has been given to the fact that the earlier withdrawal of exemption was reversed.
